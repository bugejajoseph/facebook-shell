A mini-API Python Facebook client that can be used for interacting with the Graph API and Facebook Query Language (FQL). Technically, this gist can be used to post new stories, upload photos, retrieve posts and a variety of other tasks that an app might need to do. This API implements the FB authentication flow that is based on the OAuth 2.0 protocol.

## Build

Edit `fbshell.py` to set APP_ID, HOST_NAME and SERVER_PORT to match your App ID, host name and server port number, respectively. To get a new APP_ID you will have to register your application with Facebook at http://developers.facebook.com/setup/.

## Run

From your terminal window execute the following command and simply follow the on-screen instructions:

    ```
	python fbshell.py
    ```
